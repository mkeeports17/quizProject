# Setting up the push

## You only have to do this step once

1. Fork the repository to your personal Github account
2. Clone your repository

## Once that is done, repeat the next 3 steps whenever you need to push changes
### In the terminal, type: 

- git add *
- git commit -a -m "Commit message"
- git push -u origin main


# Syncing up any changes

### In the terminal, type: 

- git fetch
- git pull

### Do this step before making any changes to confirm both repos match
